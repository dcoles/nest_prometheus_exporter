# Prometheus Nest exporter

Prometheus Exporter for Nest devices (e.g. Nest Thermostat)

## ⚠️ Important

This exporter uses the old ["Works with Nest" API](https://developers.nest.com/)
which has [now been sunset by Google](https://blog.google/products/google-nest/works-with-nest).

You can still use this exporter, but only if you have a pre-existing developer token.
